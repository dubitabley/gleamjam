## Notes on this

Just keeping notes of gleam related things

https://github.com/renatillas/mascarpone/pull/4
Had this issue with mascarpone on windows so created this to fix it

Hitting https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues/5132 quite a bit
^ this went away after removing local reference to mascarpone

## Thoughts on gleam the language:

Very much like elm in a lot of ways

todo:

- add enemies
- add ui - waves and enemies and points
- try out animations
- potentially add way to rotate lucy
- change background
- add load progress to page
- upgrades to tower?
- health bars

done:

- fix up texture loader
- add main menu
