# Gleam game jam

I have never tried gleam before so this is me trying it out for [this game jam](https://gamejam.gleam.community/)
Using [tiramisu](https://hexdocs.pm/tiramisu/) because it seems neat and i've used three.js before so shouldn't be too painful I assume.

## Development

Run locally via the following:

```sh
gleam run -m lustre/dev start
```

Or view the game at https://gleamjam.dubitable.xyz
